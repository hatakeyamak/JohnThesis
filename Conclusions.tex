\section{Analysis Results}

The tests that were run on these new readout modules were the final tests before installation on the HE on the CMS detector. With the LHC now producing high energy collisions at a faster rate, these new electronics will be very helpful in finding new particles. The readout modules in the test stand performed as expected and showed they are capable of performing the task
