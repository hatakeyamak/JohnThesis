\section{Analysis Results}

The tests that were run on these new readout modules were the final tests before installation on the HE on the CMS detector. With the LHC now producing high energy collisions at a faster rate, these new electronics will be very helpful in finding new particles. The readout modules in the test beam performed as expected and showed they are capable of performing the task for which they were designed. We were also able to extract useful information about the readout modules. The pulse shape analysis using the test beam data was very successful. It was expected that the pulse shape would be similar to a Landau Gaussian function which is what the analysis showed. It also gave consistent results over different runs and showed little change at increased energies. This pulse shape will allow the extraction of individual particle signals in the CMS detector.
